# Pollen

In the past year, social media has shown how much mutual aid and crowdfunding
can help organizations and individuals bloom. One of the biggest blockers to 
contributing to these campaigns is a lack of transparency or goal fulfillment 
after the transaction has occured. Pollen aims to provide this transparency by 
implementing blockchain technology to verify how donations spend what they're given, 
as well as organize worthy campaigns into a map of New York City, in order to
make donating easier, trustworthy, and organized. Bees (donaters) can donate their
Pollen to Flowers (organizations and individuals fundraising for particular goals)
to make New York's garden bloom brighter.
